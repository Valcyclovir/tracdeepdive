Our engineering team has utilized the data available from the Bitcoin blockchain and put it in the context of GS1 standards for tracking goods and events and published it on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network. Using the underlying data layer capabilities and graph technology, the team was able to easily aggregate information in the GS1 standardised form, enabling us to do a graph visualization of how the stolen funds are being transferred and to add new, unstructured data to the graph as it becomes available.
