# Trace Alliance

The [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/) is a collaboration partnership hub connecting 100+ businesses, startups, academics, business leaders and technology vendors with supply chain subject matter experts. The collaborative effort of the alliance resolves different organizational challenges in supply chains management. The Alliance was formed to establish common ground for the prompt and effective utilisation of blockchain up to its full potential. The Trace Alliance allows companies to receive early access to developing technologies, facilitating new application deployment centered around the OriginTrail protocol.

Trace Alliance works like a marketplace that connects companies that want to use the protocol as part of their business solutions but don’t have the IT and blockchain resources, with companies that have Implementation capabilities. There are participation fees.&#x20;
