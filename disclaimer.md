Tracdeepdive is maintained by [BRX](https://twitter.com/otnoderunner), OriginTrail community admin. This information hub is intended for educational purposes only, and does not constitute a financial advice.

Due to a lack of manpower, some illustrations and texts were directly taken from the Official OriginTrail website and the Official OriginTrail Medium, as well as public presentations done by the team. Illustrations and texts from community members were also used with their permission.&#x20;

Should anyone wish to remove any material on this website, they can reach me on Telegram @BRX86, Discord BRX#1315, Twitter @otnoderunner.&#x20;

The purpose of Tracdeepdive is to be the central hub to all information related to OriginTrail and putting them together in one place for easier following of events by the common user. I do not receive any incentives from anyone other than donations.
