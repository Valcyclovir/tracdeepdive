# TRAC Deep Dive

OriginTrail is an **open protocol** that can integrate blockchains and legacy systems through open standards – full compliance with [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/), [EPCIS 2.0/CBV](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-joins-the-gs1-global-epcis-cbv-2-0-a032b98d9437) and [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/).

Simply put, it is the combination of two technologies:

1. [Knowledge Graphs](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-a-knowledge-graph/) – which are advanced databases used by big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Uber to derive value from user data.
2. Blockchain – which enables decentralization, meaning the database is not controlled by for-profit companies.

When combining these two, it provides a backbone that decentralized applications can be built on, leveling the playing field and giving users back control of their data. OriginTrail **Decentralized Knowledge Graph** makes physical assets (art, healthcare, fashion, education) and digital assets (Metaverse, NFTs, blockchain, DeFi) **discoverable**, **verifiable** and **valuable**. It is the portal to all Web2 assets to the **Semantic Web3**.

OriginTrail is currently used by the [**British Standard Institution (BSI)**](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/)**,** [**SCAN Association**](https://www.scanassociation.com/)**,** [**The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH)**](https://wfh.org/)**,** [**EU-funded SmartAgriHubs**](https://www.smartagrihubs.eu/flagship-innovation-experiment/28-FIE-decentralised-trust-in-agrifood-supply-chains)**,** [**Swiss Federal Railways (SBB)**](https://www.sbb.ch/en)**,** [**Acala**](https://acala.network/)**,** [**PolkaDot**](https://polkadot.network/) and many more (see below).

### For starters, let's delve into this video

### Let's hear a few words from the Father of Ethernet

### Dr. Bob Metcalfe

#### “OriginTrail is going to continue to rise because the Decentralized Knowledge Graph will give AI more and more data.”

#### “The weakness of OriginTrail is that it’s too complicated to explain to ordinary mortals. The technology appears a bit like middleware, which is a category that only tends to excite a handful of people, and I’m one of them” [(source)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ethernet-creator-metcalfe-web3-will-have-all-kinds-of-network-effects/)

### A word from on of the Founder of OriginTrail
