> [OriginTrail technology is amazing](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=2958). Part of the technology right now that OriginTrail is using together with Oneagrix is to empower the African continent. [We do have a project going on with the government of Nigeria](https://halalfocus.net/nigeria-to-leverage-on-public-private-partnership-with-oneagrix-for-better-agriculture-and-halal-market-access-under-afcfta/) ([AfCFTA](https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/what-is-the-african-continental-free-trade-area-and-why-does-it-matter-to-the-islamic-economy?utm\_source=Salaam+Gateway+Weekly+Newsletters\&utm\_campaign=2ef78aad3e-EMAIL\_CAMPAIGN\_2019\_11\_24\_06\_09\_COPY\_01\&utm\_medium=email\&utm\_term=0\_c1e2a0613b-2ef78aad3e-229598204)). It’s called Nigeria feeds the world initiative, which will use OriginTrail as a layer of data transparency on the OneAgrix platform. We can not only use that data to do cross-border trade but at the same time to empower people. We’re talking about lowering poverty rates, we’re talking about giving economic empowerment to the continent. And you know Africa truly can feed itself, it will feed the world. It’s not just all about profits for us, the transparent supply chain is also about sustainability and we take this really seriously. **OriginTrail will change the world.**

<summary>Here are a few more words by Diana Sabrain, CEO of OneAgrix. The full event can be watched below. </summary>

[What OneAgrix does is](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=817) we are the world’s largest halal and agricultural digital trade ecosystem. What we do is we have an end-to-end solution for cross-border trade and this would span from DNA traceability solutions all the way to matching solutions, payment, logistics. All in on one platform.

[What we’ve been doing with OriginTrail](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=841) since 2019 was to create an e-commerce environment where we could verify data agriculture to cart. What we are doing is also consolidating agricultural and halal data onto one platform and it allows us to create more transparency. The transparent supply chain is also about sustainability and we take this really seriously.

[When we speak to procurement offices](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=2337) from the halal sector, where 7-8% of procurement offices that purchase halal products are non-Muslims, they don’t know any better about halal certification data. Some of them would not be able to ascertain whether in terms of import laws, is the halal certification accredited So, you are now looking at a $2,5Tn industry being fragmented as one, but how is data traveling?… This is where we partnered with OriginTrail.
