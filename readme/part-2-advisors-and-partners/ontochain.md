[Ontochain](https://ontochain.ngi.eu/) is a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable and transparent ontological knowledge on blockchain. It is a European project funded by the European Commission under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Call topic ICT-54) and it is part of the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative. This government funded initiative is an effort to develop technologies capable of defending the data security of European ventures and help ensure the internet remains a level playing field globally. OriginTrail is among the [selected projects](https://ontochain.ngi.eu/selected-projects) to help build this initiative by introducing four Knowledge Economy Incentivisation Tools (kToken, kWallet, kMarketplace, kTender). With these tools, the core developer team of OriginTrail aims to enhance ONTOCHAIN’s distributed storage, core protocols, and application protocols stack. Ultimately, this will facilitate the transition from a broken data economy to a trusted, semantic, human-centric, and privacy by design knowledge economy.
