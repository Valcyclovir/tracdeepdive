> Previous versions of OriginTrail (up to including v5) have made it possible for all groups of users (enterprises, government sector, Web3 builders etc.) to connect and verify information thanks to the semantic and linked data technology intertwined with the multi-chain blockchain layer. The v6 now magnifies by a **magnitude of 500x** both the scale and the scope of capabilities given to DKG users as they transform data publishings into the **omniverse of assets** they will now be able to grow in value.
